### Card Dispenser 
I collaborated with a team to produce the "Cardier Automatic Card Dispenser" that used facial detection using a pi camera and was programmed by an raspberry pi using python code. The purpose of crreating this project was to make card games more accessible to the elderly and those with disabilities. The card dispenser shuffles the cards and uses the pi camera to detect the person, dispense a card randomly, and move onto the next person. A DC motor was used to rotate the dispenser and a servo motor was used to dispense the cards at a certain speed, using GPIO pins each motor had a set number of pins designated to it to ensure they were running correctly. The model of the Card Dispenser was made on AutoCad and Onshape to make the dimesnsions of the motors and GPIO could fit inside of the dispenser where parts of the dispense and logo were 3D printed and assembled together.
